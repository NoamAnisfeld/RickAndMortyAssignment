# Rick and Morty Explorer
This app has been built for a candidate assignment

In order to run the app, do one of the following:
1. Simply visit https://noamanisfeld.github.io/RickAndMortyAssignment/
2. Run it locally by downloading the repository, then running `pnpm install` and `pnpm run dev`.
   It would probably also run fine if you use `npm install` and `npm run dev`, but I haven't tried.
